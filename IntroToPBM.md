## 1. The framework
* **number balance** on particles of a particular state
* variation of particle state = rate of formation or rate of disappearance can be viewed as **convective** motion in the particle space, these processes do not impact the total number of particles.
* processes that impact the total number of particles are **birth-and-death** processes.
* The phenomenological content of population balance models lies in the convective processes as well as the birth-and-death processes.
* The number density function, along with the environmental phase variables, completely determines the evolution of all properties of the dispersed
phase system.

### 1.1 Particle state vector
The choice of the particle state variables depends on the
application, it is determined by the variables needed to specify the rate of change of those of interest of the application, and the birth-and-death processes.

* it is adequate for most practical applications to assume that the
particle state can be described by a finite dimensional vector.

a distinction is made between **external** coordinates, denoting the position of the particle, and **internal** coordinates representing different quantities associated with the particle

### 1.2 The continuous phase vector
We thus define a continuous phase vector which is a function only of the external coordinates r and time t.
